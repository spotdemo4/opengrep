  "Like grep but for code: fast and syntax-aware semantic code pattern for many languages"
description: """
Opengrep is like grep but for searching patterns at the AST level while
leveraging semantic information (e.g., types, control flow) for powerful
matching.

This project is a fork of Semgrep, created by Semgrep Inc. Opengrep is not
affiliated with or endorsed by Semgrep Inc.
