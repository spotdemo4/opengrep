(* Taint-tracking via ranges
 * -------------------------
 *
 * First we run a bunch of search queries to obtain the ranges of sources,
 * sanitizers, and sinks. The actual analysis happens in Dataflow_tainting
 * using the IL representation. There we check whether the eorig's and iorig's
 * are within those ranges to decide whether an expression or instruction is a
 * source of taint, a sanitizer, or a sink. Finally we collect the results
 * produced by the dataflow analysis and filter out duplicates.
 *
 * We could think of using an equality test to compare ranges, e.g., an
 * expression would be a source of taint only if its range is exactly one of
 * the ranges matched by `pattern-sources`. In practice, this does not work
 * because `pattern-sources` etc can match anything, and the IL eorig's and
 * iorig's are only expressions. For example, `pattern-sources` can match
 * `foo(x);` but the eorig in the IL will be `foo(x)` whose range does not
 * include the ending `;`.
 *
 * So, we use sub-range checks. And this actually provides some extra power,
 * as it allows us to mark anything as a source/sanitizer/sink. For example,
 * we could use a pattern like `if (E) { ... }` to specify that anything
 * inside such an `if` statement should be considered sanitized. We are not
 * limited to expressions or single statements.
 *
 * However, using sub-range checks leads to duplicates. For example, the PHP
 * expression `sink("$source" . 'here')` will be translated to IL as two
 * instructions `tmp = "$source" . 'here'` and `sink(tmp)`. If `sink(...)`
 * is a `pattern-sinks`, then both instructions' ranges are inside
 * the `pattrn-sinks` ranges. If `$source` is a `pattern-sources`, then both
 * instructions are also tainted, and Dataflow_tainting will report two
 * matches.
 *
 * So, we need to remove duplicate subamtches at the end.
 * TODO: We could perhaps do this in a cleaner way by having an intermediate
 * step where we annotate the Generic AST, marking which statements and
 * expressions are sources, sanitizers, or sinks. If e.g. an expression is a
 * sink, we take care not to mark as sinks any of its subexpressions, in order
 * to prevent duplicates.
