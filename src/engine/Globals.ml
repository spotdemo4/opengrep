(* The goal of this module is mostly to document the "dangerous" globals
 * used inside Semgrep.
 *
 * Ultimately, we want to eliminate all globals. Until now, those globals did
 * not create too many issues because of the use of Parmap and fork
 * in Core_scan.ml (the modifications of those globals in the child process
 * do not affect the state in the parent process), but as soon as we migrate to
 * using domains instead with OCaml 5.0, those globals will haunt us back.
 * Maybe Domain-local-storage globals could help, but even better if we
 * can eliminate them.
 *
 * To find candidates for those "dangerous" globals, you can start with:
 *  $ ./bin/opengrep-cli --experimental -e 'val $V: $T ref' -l ocaml src/ libs/
 *  $ ./bin/opengrep-cli --experimental -e 'let $V: $T = ref $X' -l ocaml src/ libs/
 *
 * We also need to look for things like hash tables and [Lazy.t] and [Str], which are
 * not thread-safe: 
 *  $ ./bin/opengrep-cli --experimental -e 'let $H = Hashtbl.create $I' -l ocaml src/ libs/
 *  $ ./bin/opengrep-cli --experimental -e 'Lazy.force $L' -l ocaml src/ libs/
 *  $ ./bin/opengrep-cli --experimental -e 'Str.$F' -l ocaml src/ libs/
 *  NOTE: Some [Str] functions have been improved to work with less issues in Domains. 
 *
 * And to check use of Lwt which may have issues with memprof-limits cancellation: 
 *  $ ./bin/opengrep-cli -e 'Lwt_platform.$F' -l ocaml src/ libs/
 *  $ ./bin/opengrep-cli -e 'Lwt.$F' -l ocaml src/ libs/
 *)

module TLS = Thread_local_storage

(* Useful for defensive programming, especially in tests which may leave
 * bad state behind.
 * Note that it's currently unused, because we should prefer to fix our tests
 * to restore the globals they modified, but as a last resort, you can
 * use this function.
