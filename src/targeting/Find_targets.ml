   Find target file candidates from one or more scanning roots.

   ***************************************************************************

   Definitions:
   - scanning root: a path specified on the command line. It may be a folder,
     a regular file, or a symbolic link that resolves to a folder or a
     regular file.
   - target: a regular file that semgrep will scan.
   - project: a folder containing target files in its subfolders. The notion
     of project allows us to locate and consult project-specific settings
     such as '.semgrepignore' files.
   - physical path: a path '/a/b/c' is a physical path to file 'c' if
     neither '/a/b/c', '/a/b', '/a', or '/' are symlinks.

   ***************************************************************************

   Challenges:
   - symbolic links! Symlinks make it possible and common for multiple paths
     to identify the same file. When the user specifies a path on the command
     line, error messages and semgrep results should use that path as
     a prefix rather than an equivalent path.
   - Semgrep accepts scanning roots that potentially belong to different
     projects (unlike Git).
   - the current folder doesn't necessarily belong to the project (unlike
     with Git).

   ***************************************************************************

   How to produce nice target paths?
   = How to identify project roots correctly and return target paths that
   have the scanning root as prefix?

   1. To guarantee that each target belongs to exactly one project and avoid
      confusion, the project root is determined using the physical path
      to the scanning root.
      -> use 'realpath' to get the physical path to the scanning root and
         consult its parent folders recursively until finding the project root.

   2. To reference the path to a target within the project, we use an
      in-project path that is relative to the project root.
      -> list the regular files under the scanning root and express
         their path relative to the project root.

   3. When returning a path to a target file to a user, we make sure
      that the path has the original scanning root path i.e. not necessarily
      a physical or absolute path, followed by the path from the scanning
      root to the target file.
      -> take the in-project path to a target and express it relative it
         the in-project path to the scanning root.
      -> concatenate the original file system path to the scanning root
         with the target path relative to the scanning root.

   Here's an example:

     scanning root: myproject-v2/src
     'myproject-v2' is a symlink: myproject-v2 -> ../myproject
     physical path to the scanning root: /home/me/myproject/src
     project root (physical path): /home/me/myproject
     physical path to some target file: /home/me/myproject/src/hello/hello.py
     in-project path to the target file: /src/hello/hello.py
     final path to the target file: myproject-v2/src/hello/hello.py

   ***************************************************************************

   Performance: collecting target candidates is a one-time operation
   that can be relatively expensive (O(number of files)).

   Partially translated from target_manager.py

   Original python comments:

     Assumes file system does not change during it's existence to cache
     files for a given language etc. If file system changes
     (i.e. git checkout), create a new TargetManager object

     If respect_gitignore is true then will only consider files that are
     tracked or (untracked but not ignored) by git

     If git_baseline_commit is true then will only consider files that have
     changed since that commit

     If allow_unknown_extensions is set then targets with extensions that are
     not understood by semgrep will always be returned by get_files. Else will
     discard targets with unknown extensions

   TODO:
    - optimize, reduce the number of filesystem lookup? or memoize them?
      there are a few places where we stat for a file
    - add an option to select all git-tracked files regardless of
      gitignore or semgrepignore exclusions (will be needed for Secrets)
      and have the exclusions apply only to the files that aren't tracked.

(* Yet another file path related type ...

   This module is a bit fragile as it assumes that target file paths found in
   the file system have the same form as those passed on the command line.
   It won't work with unnormalized paths such as 'foo/../bar.js' that will
   likely be rewritten into 'bar.js'. See:

     $ git ls-files libs/../README.md
     README.md

   This results in 'README.md' being treated as non-explicit target file.

   TODO: use pairs (project, ppath) instead as keys? If we use a dedicated
   record for targets, we can extract the pair (project, ppath):

     type target = {
       project: Project.t; (* provides normalized project root *)
       path: Fppath.t; (* provides (normalized) ppath *)
     }

   If we go this path, we could also add a field 'is_explicit: bool' to the
   target type.

   Target files are identified by following these steps:

   1. A list of folders or files are specified explicitly on the command line.
      These are referred to as "explicit" targets and they should not
      be filtered out even if they match some exclusion patterns.
      This is the input of the 'get_targets' function.
   2. If the project is a git project, use 'git ls-files' or
      equivalent to expand the scanning roots into a list of files.
      This list may include files that would be excluded by the gitignore
      mechanism but are nonetheless being tracked by git (it happens).
   3. The scanning roots from step (1) are expanded using our own
      semgrepignore mechanism. This allows the inclusion of additional
      files that are not under git control because .semgrepignore
      files allows de-exclusion/re-inclusion patterns such as e.g.
      '!*.min.js'.
      Typically, the sets of files produced by (2) and (3) overlap vastly.
   4. Take the union of (2) and (3).
