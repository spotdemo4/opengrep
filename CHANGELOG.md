## [1.1.0](https://github.com/opengrep/opengrep/releases/tag/v1.1.0) - 31-03-2025

### New features

* Add support for reporting enclosure of matches by @maciejpirog in #169 and #178
* Resurrection of Elixir by @mbacarella and @dimitris-m in #150

### Details

There's now a new flag `--output-enclosing-context` that can be added to the `scan` command, adding information about the surrounding context of the matched fragments of code, such as the innermost function and/or class in which the match occurs.

This is only available for json output, so the `--json`flag must also be passed, and it's an experimental feature so it also requires `--experimental`.

Elixir support has been restored and will continue to be improved.
