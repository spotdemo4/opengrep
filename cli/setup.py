    # Flexibility is achieved by, in order of preference:
    # 1. >=x if you know the earliest version that works with Semgrep
    # 2. >=x,<y if you know the earliest version that works with Semgrep,
    #    and know that a later version breaks Semgrep.
    # 3. ~=x.0 if you don't know the earliest version that works with Semgrep
